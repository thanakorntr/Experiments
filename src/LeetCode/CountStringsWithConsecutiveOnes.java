 *
 * Given a number n, count number of n length strings with consecutive 1â€™s in them.

 Examples:

 Input  : n = 2
 Output : 1
 There are 4 strings of length 2, the
 strings are 00, 01, 10 and 11. Only the
 string 11 has consecutive 1's.

 Input  : n = 3
 Output : 3
 There are 8 strings of length 3, the
 strings are 000, 001, 010, 011, 100,
 101, 110 and 111.  The strings with
 consecutive 1's are 011, 110 and 111.

 Input : n = 5
 Output : 19
